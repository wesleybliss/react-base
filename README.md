# React Base

> Basic starter for react

## WIP

- This branch uses ESBuild
- Most of the original Webpack files still exist _(@todo delete these once it's stable)_
- ESBuild doesn't support HMR, but this branch supports live reload, which is _(almost)_ as fast

## Included

- React
- React Router
- Forminator React Wire
- Tailwind + PostCSS
- Day.js
- React Icons

## Installation

```
$ git clone git@github.com:wesleybliss/react-base.git
